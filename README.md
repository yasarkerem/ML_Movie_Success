# ML_Movie_Success

## Introduction
It is subjective that whether a movie is successful or not. Some people think that a movie is successful if it has the most views, whereas others think that "Mainstream" is not always the best measure of success,
since a very unsuccessful movie may be watched the most. Although the definiton of success in movie is subjective to every individual, “a successful movie” can be determined by such exploratory data analysis, by considering all parameters together. This Project aims to investigate a movie database, which contains 4803 movies, and try to find the effectiveness of parameters in terms of success.

# Problem Definition
Aim of this project is to extract reliable and applicable information which may give a tangible intuition to a film-maker about the possible nominative features of an upcoming film that would satisfy the expectations of people, by analyzing movies that have launched from the beginning of 20th century until today. We will try to formulize the key factors that what makes a movie successful and validate this formula with our dataset analysis. Overall, the project offers a solution that methodologically answers the questions “What are the qualities of an ideal film?” and “What makes a movie successful or award-winner?” considering specific parameters and time periods which are collected from the examined datasets.
